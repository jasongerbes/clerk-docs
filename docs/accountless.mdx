**Accountless Mode** allows you to try out Clerk in your local development environment without having to sign-up for a Clerk account first.

## How does it work?

If Clerk's SDK doesn't detect valid [Clerk keys](TODO) in your environment, it will automatically fetch a set of keys for you. These keys are associated with a Clerk development instance that has a default configuration. When running locally in Accountless Mode, you'll see a banner indicating that you're running in this special mode with a link to claim your 

### Default configuration

Clerk development instances have the following default configuration:

* **Authentication**: Email and password, Sign-in with Google
* **Verification**: Email verification is required
* **Password reset**: Password reset is enabled
* **MFA**: MFA is disabled
* **Appearance**: Default appearance

When using Clerk in Accountless Mode, you're not able to make configuration changes to your instance. To make changes, [claim your instance](#claiming-accountless-keys).


## Accountless Mode support

### Clerk SDKs

Accountless Mode is useful when you want to quickly try out Clerk in your local development environment without having to sign-up for a Clerk account first. It works with Clerk's SDKs for [Next.js](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs), [Remix](/docs/quickstarts/remix), [RedwoodJS](/docs/quickstarts/redwood) and [Tanstack Start](/docs/quickstarts/tanstack-start).

## Claiming accountless keys

When you're ready to make configuration changes to your instance, you can claim your accountless keys. To do this, click the "Claim your instance" button in the Clerk UI on your local development. You'll then be prompted to sign-up for a Clerk account, or sign-in if you already have one. From there, the keys will be associated with your account. 

You'll need to copy and paste the keys into your `.env` file to persist them in your project. This will disable Accountless mode.
